# HealthyBattery
An Android application to help the user have good habits, so that the battery can last longer.


##Why I made this:
-It was on my to-do list for a while, so why not ;)

-Use battery manager class

-To learn more things about Android

-To have the chance to personalize my app

#Features:
-Show basic data about the battery such as: 

                                            -Status
                                            
                                            -Type of plug
                                            
                                            -Battery Level
                                            
                                            -Health
                                            
                                            -Battery Technology
                                            
                                            -Battery Temperature
                                            
                                            -Battery Voltage
                                            
-Graph with battery evolution

-Notification (Alert Dialog (for now)) (when the app is open) if the battery is too high or too low and if the temperature is too high or to low

-Settings to define: 

                     -Temperature format (ÂºC or F)
                     
                     -Notification with one play/loop sound and with or withou vibration
                     
                     -Choose the battery level of when you want to be notified (recommended: 30%)
                     
-Tips to make the battery last longer and stay in good health

-Service that collects the battery level (in normal mode and in DOZE, every 30 minutes) (Still in Beta and it's buggy)
